# Linux-Admin-Essentials
Simple scripts to simplify the job of a Linux System Administrator.
Navig.sh will show basic information about the user's current environment
Newusrandgrp.sh will simplify the creation of a new group and new user and making the new group the primary group of the new user
Delusrandgrp.sh will simplify the deletion of a User and a Group
Loops were used in Newusrandgrp.sh and Delusrandgrp.sh to remind the script user if a problem has occurred with the process being executed and asks them to make new entries as a result
